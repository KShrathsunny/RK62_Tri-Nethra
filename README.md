>as well as from the official crime portal of GOI.

## Working :
- First, the chatbot, in a very intuitive way, understands the category of Cybercrime the user had to face and subsequently, as per the user's wish, it redirects to the official portal or the bot itself collects all the relevant information and generates an **investigation report** which then is forwarded to the concerned official.

- The user is redirected to the official cyber portal for queries related to awareness and **in-chat suggestions** are also incorporated.

- For each complaint raised, a **token** is generated and provided to the victim which helps him/her refer the status of the complaint in the future.

- The system is also providing a multi-platform and user-friendly application which carries out all the functionalities of the chatbot and which can be easily extended to future integrations.
