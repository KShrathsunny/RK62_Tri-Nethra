[Tri-Nethra Working Model](https://trinethra73.herokuapp.com/ "Working Model")

_Each Individual folder has its own readme, please go through it, This page just gives an overview, please visit each page for further clarity_

## Before the Overview of the Project:

### Jsons and API keys

This project relies upon multiple configured Jsons and API keys which we have included in the APIs folder. For proper functioning of the application ,appropriate API key or config JSON shall be placed in respective fields in order to make calls to them. In case of errors, kindly recheck whether all the JSON/API keys are in-place.

### Collaborator Perplexity
We were facing multiple collaborating issues throughout the project because of certain previous version pushes and pull requests (_resulting in many conflicts which in turn needed much time to resolve), _so even though everyone equally made their contributions to the project,
_we had to push a single platform code through a single user only._
(Hope you Understand)

### Delay in the commits
The Code in commits was pushed well before 4pm, we're just adding readme and Config files, so that it would help you if you want to run locally

We were not informed about the timely commits and pushes requirement at the initial stages of the hackathon, _We were collecting code from all our contributors/team members to merge into a  single big commit till then_,( All the commits were done from time to time since we were informed about this) 
Thank you for understanding.
_We completely ensure that the entire project along with the changes have been done genuinely and no malpractices have occured._


### Mobile App
We even developed a native multi-platform mobile application with all the functionalities(and even more) of the chatbot that _we may intend to use for future purposes or to be integrated with any existing government system._ But this was out of context for the problem statement domain bucket, _we're not considering it to the final build, we may use it as per the future requirements._


### Credentials 
There is a file placed in the JSON and API folder named credentials, kindly go through that for any required credentials needed for the project.

## There are 2 Main modules and other supporting folders:
